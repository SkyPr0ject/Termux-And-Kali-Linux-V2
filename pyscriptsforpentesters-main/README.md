### Day 02: Creating An FTP Brute-Forcer(ftpbust3r)
In this tutorial you will learn how to crack ftp servers using dictionary attack(brute force with a word-list) with the help of a ftplib module in python. A brute-force attack is an attack that submits many passwords to a password protected file or service with the hope of guessing correctly.

We will be using the ftplib module which comes built-in with python and colorama (third-part) module to print colors in python.

### Day 03: Creating Your Own Keylogger (keybust3r)
In this guide, we are going to learn how to code a very effective, yet precise keylogger using a third-part python module called pynput. In case if you don't know, a keylogger is program that monitors keystrokes. A keylogger's basic functionality is to monitor keystrokes continuously and sent those keystrokes to a specific location, that can be either your email, server, or stored locally in your system.
